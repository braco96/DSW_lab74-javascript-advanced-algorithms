# LAB | JS Advanced Algorithms

## Pre: Tareas que hemos realizado
- He implementado la l√≥gica de pilas y colas.
- He controlado los errores de overflow y underflow.
- He preparado la interfaz para mostrar las estructuras.

## Learning Goals

After this exercise, you will be able to:

- Use stack and queue data structures to organize your application information
- Learn how to model real-life situations and objects into proper data structures
- Develop your code solution in accordance with the tests.

## Data Structures

A [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) is a particular way to organize your data so it can be used efficiently. One or more [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) can be implemented and they specify the operations that can be performed over a data structure.

In this exercise, we will implement two different abstract data types that are very common: `stacks` and `queues`. Let's take a look at both data structures to understand how they work.
